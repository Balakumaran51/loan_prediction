The credit system governed by banks is one of the most important factors affecting our country's 
economy and financial condition. The process of evaluating bank credit risk is recognised by banks 
all over the world. "As we all know, credit risk evaluation is critical, and a variety of techniques 
are used to calculate risk levels. Furthermore, credit risk is one of the primary functions of the 
banking industry.

One of the most difficult tasks for any bank is predicting credit defaulters. However, by forecasting 
loan defaulters, banks can definitely reduce their loss by reducing their non-profit assets, so that approved 
loans can be recovered without any loss, and it can play a contributing parameter of the bank statement. This 
emphasises the significance of researching loan approval prediction. Machine Learning techniques are extremely 
important and useful in predicting this type of data.

Classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, and xgboost will be used. These algorithms 
will be used to train and test the data. The best model is chosen here is Random forest and saved in pkl format, 
and it will be integrated with flask.
